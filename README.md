# Pen-simulation

### Description

This project is a text-based writing simulation game where users can simulate writing with a pen, choose various pen attributes, and manage ink levels.

**Interactive Writing Process:** Users can write texts with different ink colors, nib types, and cartridge types. The game checks and manages the ink level based on the text written.

**Ink Management:** The ink level decreases as the user writes. Users are prompted to refill the ink if it runs out.

**Text Storage:** Written texts are saved to a file named "written_story.txt". Users can read the contents of the file at the end of the game.


This is a python project that uses OOPs concept to implement a simple pen simulation.
